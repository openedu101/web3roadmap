# Asset lifecycle
The lifecycle for assets on Algorand consists of the following steps:

1. **Creation**: Any account on Algorand can create an asset.
2. **Configure Roles**: Set roles for managers, reserve, clawback, and freeze.
3. **Transfer**: Assets can be moved from one account to another. The receiver must opt in first to avoid spam.
4. **Freeze**: Assets can be frozen to stop transactions. This prevents assets from being transferred or used temporarily.
5. **Clawback**: An issuer can take back tokens from a specific address.
6. **Destroy**: Assets can be destroyed. This must be done by the asset manager

Each of these steps ensures that assets on the Algorand network are managed securely and efficiently, providing a robust framework for asset lifecycle management.
