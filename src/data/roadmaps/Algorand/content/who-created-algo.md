# Who created ALGO?

Created by computer scientist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is perhaps rare in that it was started by an established academic who already had a distinguished career at the time of its launch. 

Micali, for example, is the recipient of a 2012 Turing Award, a notable accolade in the world of computer science, for his work with his colleague Shafi Goldwasser.
