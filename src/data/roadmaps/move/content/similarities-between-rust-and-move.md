# Similarities Between Rust and Move

## Memory Safety
Both Rust and Move prioritize memory safety.

* Rust achieves this through its ownership model and borrowing rules, preventing data races and null pointer dereferencing. 

* Move, while not dealing with memory management directly, ensures safety by treating resources as first-class citizens that must be explicitly created, transferred, and destroyed.


## Modular Design
* Rust's module system allows for the organization and reuse of code, making it easier to manage complex projects.

* Similarly, Move's modular design encourages the creation of reusable and composable modules, enabling developers to build complex smart contracts from simpler components.
