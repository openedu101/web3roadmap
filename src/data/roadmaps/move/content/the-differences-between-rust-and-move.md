# Key Differences Between Rust and Move

## Resource-Oriented Programming

The difference between Rust and Move is the resource-oriented programming.
 
In Move, resources represent assets that cannot be duplicated or discarded. This is crucial for managing digital assets on the blockchain, ensuring their integrity and security.

## Execution Model
Rust is a general-purpose programming language designed for a wide range of applications, from system programming to web development. 

Move, on the other hand, is specifically designed for writing smart contracts. Move's execution model is built around transactions and scripts, allowing for secure and flexible interactions with the blockchain.
