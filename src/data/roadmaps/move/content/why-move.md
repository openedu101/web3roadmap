# Why Move?

Move was created to address the specific needs of blockchain development, focusing on safety, flexibility, and resource management. 

Unlike general-purpose languages, Move introduces the concept of resources that represent assets, ensuring they cannot be duplicated or discarded unintentionally. This resource-oriented programming model is designed to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of digital assets.
