# **Libra Project Announcement**

On June 18, 2019, Facebook [announced](https://libra.org/en-US/updates/introducing-libra/) a new payment system called Libra. It uses blockchain technology to move money at low cost. The Libra token is a stablecoin backed by various currencies and government securities, known as the Libra Reserve. This reserve would be held by custodian banks around the world and managed by exchanges that convert it to local currencies.

Facebook planned to create a digital wallet for Libra under a new subsidiary called [Calibra](https://messari.io/organization/calibra) (now called Novi), led by Morgan Beller, David Marcus, and Kevin Weil. The project would start as permissioned, but the goal was to make it permissionless within five years.
